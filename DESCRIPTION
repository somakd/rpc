Description: Computes the ridge partial correlation
    coefficients in a high or ultra-high dimensional linear regression
    problem. An extended Bayesian information criterion is also
    implemented for variable selection. Users provide the matrix
    of covariates as a usual dense matrix or a sparse matrix
    stored in a compressed sparse column format. Detail of the method
    is given in the manual.
